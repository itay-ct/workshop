# Stitch and Python

In this module, we'll explore creating an application that uses MongoDB Stitch. MongoDB Stitch is built into MongoDB Atlas and provides the ability to create an host serverless functions and integrations. The design goal for Stitch is to alleviate the need for creating boiler-plate code to accomplish many of the features that modern applications must present.

Because MongoDB Stitch functions are JavaScript based, we will leverage a feature of Stitch which enables you to connect to your MongoDB database through Stitch. More on this below.

## Prerequisites

You should have already completed the MongoDB Atlas module of this workshop and should therefore already have a cluster available to you. If you have not yet completed this module, go back and review module 01 - MongoDB Atlas to ensure that you have a working cluster with sample data available.  Additionally, you may wish to review the [Atlas Getting Started Documentation](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/).

Once you've completed building an Atlas cluster and loading sample data, move on to step 1. Creating a Stitch App.

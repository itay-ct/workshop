## Deploying an Atlas Cluster

Create an Account or Log In to [Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com).

We’ll be using MongoDB Atlas, our fully managed Database as a Service, for this workshop. Go to [https://cloud.mongodb.com](https://cloud.mongodb.com) and either create a new account or log into an existing account you may have previously created. Create a new Atlas project to use in this workshop.

** Note that the Atlas team sometimes experiment with the UI to make things more intuitive – that means that your experience might not match what you see here **

Leave the remaing options set to the defaults and skip down to the bottom section where you can set the Cluster Name.

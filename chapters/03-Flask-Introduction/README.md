# Flask Introduction

## What is Flask?

Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug. It's called a microframework because it's very lightweight, easy to install and generally pleasant to work with.

## Why use Flask?

Flask enables you to get a web application up and running with relatively little effort. Flask manages creation of the listener and simplifies the process of creating routes in your application.

## Flask Alternatives

Python is an amazing language and because it's so popular, there are literally dozens of web application frameworks designed to simplify the process of creating web applications with Python.  Flask is one of the most popular and because of its lightweight nature and simplified operations, it has become one of the most popular.  The following is a non-exhaustive list of additional frameworks as well as a brief comparison to Flask.

| Framework | Description | Comparison notes |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------------- | 
| [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) | Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions. And before you ask: It's BSD licensed! | * |
| [bottle](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html) | Bottle is a fast, simple and lightweight WSGI micro web-framework for Python. It is distributed as a single file module and has no dependencies other than the Python Standard Library.| Single file distribution model - simplified. It is a much smaller community of users, however. |
| [cherrypy](https://cherrypy.org/) | CherryPy allows developers to build web applications in much the same way they would build any other object-oriented Python program. This results in smaller source code developed in less time. | Lacks good, comprehensive documentation |
| [sanic](https://sanic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | Sanic is a Python 3.6+ web server and web framework thatâ€™s written to go fast. It allows the usage of the async/await syntax added in Python 3.5, which makes your code non-blocking and speedy. | Native async i/o. |

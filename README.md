# MongoDB Developer Workshops - Python and MongoDB (pymongo)

## Workshop Description

This workshop will build on previous content in the workshop series and explain how MongoDB can be leveraged with Python to manipulate data. This will extend and enhance your understanding of MongoDB (the database), MongoDB Atlas, and data manipulation operations using Python and the Pymongo driver.

## Course Syllabus

### Module 1 - Installing PyMongo

[This module](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/workshop/tree/python/modules/01-Installing-PyMongo) will assist you in understanding the requirements for installing the Pymongo driver.

### Module 2 - Creating / Inserting data into MongoDB using PyMongo

[This module](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/workshop/tree/python/modules/02-Create) help you understand how to insert data into your MongoDB database using Python and the PyMongo driver.

### Module 3 - Reading Data from MongoDB with PyMongo

[This module](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/workshop/tree/python/modules/03-Read) will help you understand how to access (read) data in your MongoDB database.

### Module 4 - Updating Data with PyMongo

[This module](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/workshop/tree/python/modules/04-Update) will deliver concepts around updating data in your MongoDB database using the PyMongo driver.

### Module 5 - Deleting data with PyMongo

[This module](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/workshop/tree/python/modules/05-Delete) will cover deleting data from MongoDB will PyMongo

### Module 6 - Building an Application using Flask and PyMongo

[This module(https://github.com/mongodb-developer/workshop/tree/python/modules/06-Flask-Introduction)] will build on the previous modules and demonstrate how to build a working web application leveraging Flask, and PyMongo.

### Module 7 - Stitch and Python

MongoDB Stitch is a backend as a service. Developing applications with Stitch can involve creating business logic with JavaScript using Stitch Functions. However, you can also expose MongoDB data in MongoDB Atlas through MongoDB stitch. [This module](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/workshop/tree/python/modules/07-Stitch-Python) will cover concepts required to do this.
